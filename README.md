glissando
=========

Glissando is a system to calculate a fair payment for which takes into account both the consumer's ability to pay as well as the producers's financial status and the cost of production. At it's core, Glissando is a set of calculations using multiple sliding scales.

The project is currently in the very formative stages, as is probably painfully obvious.

Factors for the calculation:
- Financial status of the consumer/patron (this may be the only required input)
- Financial status of the producer
- Production/distribution cost of the product
- Expected sales 

The Big Picture TODO list:
- [ ] Core Calculation(s) probably in Javascript to ease integration into the following platforms:
- [ ] Web
- [ ] Web service/API - for incorporation into payment systems, shopping carts, POS systems etc
- [ ] Mobile (perhaps using Appcellerator's Titanium - http://www.appcelerator.com/ )

It is probably too early to invite active collaboration, but of course this is GitHub and the project would not be here as a public project if it was not intended to be a public collaboration, so if/when you are so inclined fork away and we'll see what happens!
