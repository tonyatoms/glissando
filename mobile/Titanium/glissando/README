The files in this tree are for an Appcelerator Titanium Mobile implementation of glissando

The project was committed initially in pretty much a "Hello World" state and it may still be there.


----------------------------------
Stuff the Titanium legal folks included, but only apply to the Titanium code and not to the project code itself:
(that is all the code in this repo is open source under the MIT license, but since we are mentioning Titanium 
and Appcelerator, I'm leaving the following legal notices intact - at least for the time being.)
